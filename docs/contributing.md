# Contributing

While Hyper is currently an experiment, and in constant flux, you are
welcome to contribute. Please post ideas and start discussions
using
[the issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/owickstrom/hyper/issues).
You can also
contact [Oskar Wickstr√∂m](https://wickstrom.tech/about.html) directly
for design discussions. If this project grows, we can setup a mailing
list, or other some other means of communication.

Please note that sending pull requests without first discussing the
design is probably a waste of time, if not only fixing simple things like
typos.
