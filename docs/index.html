<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>Composing middleware in NodeJS is a risky business. They mutate the HTTP request and response objects freely, and are often dependent on each others’ side-effects. There are no guarantees that you have stacked the middleware functions in a sensible order, and it is often the case, in my experience, that misconfigured middleware takes a lot of time and effort to debug.</p>
<p>The goal of <em>Hyper</em> is to make use of row polymorphism and other tasty type system features in PureScript to enforce correctly stacked middleware in HTTP server applications. All effects of middleware should be reflected in the types to ensure that common mistakes cannot be made. A few examples could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorrect ordering header and body writing</li>
<li>Writing incomplete responses</li>
<li>Overwriting headers</li>
<li>Writing multiple responses</li>
<li>Trying to consume a non-parsed request body</li>
<li>Consuming a request body parsed as the wrong type</li>
<li>Incorrect ordering of error handling middleware</li>
<li>Incorrect ordering of middleware for sessions, authentication, authorization</li>
<li>Missing authentication and/or authorization checks</li>
<li>Linking, in an HTML anchor, to a resource that is not routed</li>
<li>Posting, in an HTML form, to a resource that is not routed</li>
</ul>
<p>Can we use the PureScript type system to eradicate this class of errors? Let’s find out!</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>These are the central components of <em>Hyper</em>. While focusing heavily on safety, Hyper tries to provide an open API that can support multiple PureScript backends, and different styles of web applications.</p>
<h3 id="conn">Conn</h3>
<p>A <em>Conn</em>, short for “connection”, models the entirety of a connection between the HTTP server and the user agent - both request and response. This design is adopted from <em>Plug</em>, an abstract HTTP interface in Elixir, that enables various HTTP libraries to inter-operate.</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>type Conn req res components = { request :: req
                               , response :: res
                               , components :: components
                               }</code></pre>
<h3 id="middleware">Middleware</h3>
<p>A <em>middleware</em> is a function transforming a <code>Conn</code> to another <code>Conn</code>, in some monadic type <code>m</code>. The <code>Middleware</code> type synonym encapsulates this concept, but it is still a regular function.</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>type Middleware m c c&#39; = c -&gt; m c&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Being able to parameterize <code>Conn</code> with some type <code>m</code>, you can customize the chain depending on the needs of your middleware and handlers. Applications can use monad transformers to track state, provide configuration, gather metrics, and much more, in the chain of middleware.</p>
<h3 id="response-state-transitions">Response State Transitions</h3>
<p>The <code>writer</code> field in the <code>response</code> record of a Conn is a value provided by the server backend. Functions usually constrain the <code>writer</code> field to be a value implementing the <code>Hyper.Core.ResponseWriter</code> type class. This makes it possible to provide response writing abstractions without depending on a specific server backend.</p>
<p>The state of a response writer is tracked in its type parameter. This state tracking, and the type signatures of functions using the response writer, guarantee correctness in response handling, preventing incorrect ordering of headers and body writes, incomplete responses, or other such mistakes. Let us have a look at the type signatures of some of response writing functions in <code>Hyper.Response</code>.</p>
<p>We see that <code>headers</code> takes a traversable collection of headers, and gives back a middleware that, given a connection <em>where headers are ready to be written</em>, writes all specified headers, writes the separating CRLF before the HTTP body, and <em>marks the state of the response writer as headers being closed</em>.</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>headers :: forall t m req res rw c.
           (Traversable t, Monad m, ResponseWriter rw m) =&gt;
           t Header
        -&gt; Middleware
           m
           (Conn req { writer :: rw HeadersOpen | res } c)
           (Conn req { writer :: rw HeadersClosed | res } c)</code></pre>
<p>To be used in combination with <code>headers</code>, the <code>respond</code> function takes some <code>Response r</code>, and gives back a middleware that, given a connection <em>where all headers have been written</em>, writes a response, and <em>marks the state of the response writer as ended</em>.</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>respond :: forall r m req res rw c.
           (Monad m, Response r, ResponseWriter rw m) =&gt;
           r
        -&gt; Middleware
           m
           (Conn req { writer :: rw HeadersClosed | res } c)
           (Conn req { writer :: rw ResponseEnded | res } c)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Response</code> type class describes types that can be written as responses.</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>class Response r where
  toResponse :: r -&gt; String</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The return type of <code>toResponse</code> should probably be something other than <code>String</code> (<a href="https://github.com/owickstrom/hyper/issues/5">GitHub issue</a>).</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>
<p><em>Here follows a collection of loosely organized thoughts on how to implement safe middleware in Hyper. Very much work-in-progress.</em></p>
<h3 id="parsing-the-request-body">Parsing the Request Body</h3>
<p>The request body is, when using the Node server, initially a <code>RequestBody</code> in the connection. The user explicitly chooses to read and parse the body with a given parser, which returns a new connection of a type reflecting the action. The following type signature resides in <code>Hyper.Node.Server</code>, and shows how a request body can be read into a <code>String</code>. The <code>Aff</code> monad, and the <code>AVAR</code> effect, is used to accomplish this asynchronously in the case of the Node server.</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>readBodyAsString
  :: forall e req res c.
     Middleware
     (Aff (http :: HTTP, err :: EXCEPTION, avar :: AVAR | e))
     (Conn { body :: RequestBody
           , contentLength :: Maybe Int
           | req
           } res c)
     (Conn { body :: String
           , contentLength :: Maybe Int | req
           } res c)</code></pre>
<p>A simple form parser can use <code>readBodyAsString</code> to convert the body a more useful format for the application. The following function checks the <code>Content-Type</code> header in the request, splits the request body, builds up a <code>Form</code> value, and finally using that value for the <code>body</code> field in the resulting <code>Conn</code>. The form body has type <code>Either Error Form</code> to represent invalid forms.</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>parseForm ∷ forall m req res c.
            Applicative m =&gt;
            Middleware
            m
            (Conn { body ∷ String
                  , headers :: StrMap String
                  | req
                  } res c)
            (Conn { body ∷ Either Error Form
                  , headers :: StrMap String
                  | req
                  }
                  res
                  c)
parseForm conn = ...</code></pre>
<p>More efficient parsers, directly operating on the <code>RequestBody</code>, instead of <code>String</code>, can of course be built as well.</p>
<h3 id="cohesion-of-links-forms-and-routes">Cohesion of Links, Forms, and Routes</h3>
<p>It should not be possible to link, using an HTML anchor, to a resource in the web application that does not exist, or that does not handle the GET method. Neither should it be possible to create a form that posts to a non-existing resource, or a resource not handling POST requests.</p>
<h4 id="resources">Resources</h4>
<p>Hyper has a concept of <em>resources</em>. Each resource is a record describing its <em>path</em>, along with a set of HTTP methods and handlers. Each method implemented in Hyper must be specified explicitly in the record with a <code>ResourceMethod</code> value, and those values are parameterized with one of the marker types describing if it is routed - <code>Supported</code> or <code>NotSupported</code>. The helper functions <code>handler</code> and <code>notSupported</code> are used to construct <code>ResourceMethod</code> values.</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>index =
  { path: []
  , &quot;GET&quot;: handler (html (h1 (text &quot;Welcome!&quot;)))
  , &quot;POST&quot;: notSupported
  }</code></pre>
<h4 id="resource-routers">Resource Routers</h4>
<p>The <code>resource</code> function creates a <code>ResourceRouter</code> that tries to route HTTP requests to handlers in its resource. It should also add the application resources as a type in the components of the Conn, giving subsequent middleware access to that information. <em>The encoding of resource types in the Conn is NOT supported yet.</em></p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>app = fallbackTo notFound (resource index)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ResourceRouter</code> provides an instance for <code>Alt</code>, making it possible to chain resources and have them try to match the request in order.</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>app = fallbackTo notFound (resource index &lt;|&gt; resource about &lt;|&gt; resource contact)</code></pre>
<h4 id="html-dsl">HTML DSL</h4>
<p>A separate DSL for writing HTML, providing functions that take resources as arguments, creates links and forms to resources in the application <em>only if they are in scope and support the required HTTP methods</em>. Paths are used from the resource, so you cannot make a typo in the URL. In other words, mistakes in routing and references between resources give you compile-time errors.</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>about =
  { path: [&quot;about&quot;]
  , &quot;GET&quot;: handler (\conn -&gt; html
                            (linkTo contact (text &quot;Contact Me!&quot;))
                            conn)
  , &quot;POST&quot;: notSupported
  }

contact =
  { path: [&quot;contact&quot;]
  , &quot;GET&quot;: handler (html (text &quot;Good luck finding my email address.&quot;))
  , &quot;POST&quot;: notSupported
  }</code></pre>
<p>As resources have to be in scope to be referred, you cannot refer to a non-existing resource. You can, however, refer to an existing resource <em>that is not routed</em>. This is described above in <a href="#resource-routers">Resource Routers</a>.</p>
<p>Erroneously using the <code>contact</code> resource together with <code>formTo</code> results in a compile error, as there is no handler for the <code>POST</code> method in <code>contact</code>.</p>
<pre class="text"><code>Error found:
in module Hyper.HTML.Example

  Could not match type

    Unsupported

  with type

    Supported
</code></pre>
