.. rubric:: Type-safe, statically checked composition of HTTP servers

Hyper is an experimental middleware
architecture for HTTP servers written in PureScript.  It is also a breeding
ground for higher-level web server constructs, which tend to fall under the
"framework" category. Right now most things live in the main repository of
Hyper, but they will most likely break free soon.

This documentation is divided into sections, each being suited for different
types of information you might be looking for.

* :doc:`introduction/index` describes the project itself; its motivations,
  goals, and relevant information for contributors to the project.
* :doc:`core-api/index` is an introduction and reference of the Core API of
  Hyper, on which the higher-level features build.
* :doc:`topic-guides/index` explain how to solve specifics tasks of writing web
  servers using features of Hyper.
* :doc:`tutorials/index` are step-by-step guides on how to build complete
  web applications.
* :doc:`extensions/index` provides an overview of extensions to Hyper.
